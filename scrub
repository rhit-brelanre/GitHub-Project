| Instrument | Description | Range | Accuracy |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| FIT-400A | A Coriolis flowmeter | 0 to 6500 kg/h full scale | ±0.10% ± [(0.012 ÷ measured value) ⋅ 100]% o.r. for a mass flowrate |
| FIT-400C | A vortex flowmeter | 7.7 to 74 kg/h | 0.75% o.r. for Reynold's Number greater than 20000 or 0.75% o.f.s. for Reynold's Numbers from 4000 to 20000 |
| FIT-400D | An orifice flowmeter | 1 to 8 GPM flow range, with a 1 to 10 GPM full scale | 1.25% flow rate |
| PIT-400A | A pressure transmitter located before the unit's pump | The span is a minimum of 1.5 psi, but it can be set to larger values during installation. The range is -14.7 psi to 150 psi | ±0.15% of span |
| PIT-400B | A pressure transmitter located after the unit's pump | The span is a minimum of 1.5 psi, but it can be set to larger values during installation. The range is -14.7 psi to 150 psi | ±0.15% of span |
| SIT-400A | Measures the power usage of the unit in Watts. | No range given | The error is assumed to be zero for this measurement |
